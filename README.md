This is the repository containing the solution to the interview assessment. 

Please note that this was done on a Mac with macOS Ventura 13.4.1, using ruby from Homebrew.

One must complete the script in the same file as the assessment for the code to run correctly.

Once the script is done, it should open the file displaying all the correct information.
